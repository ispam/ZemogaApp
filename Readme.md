# Zemoga Test

![1](https://github.com/ispam/ZemogaApp/blob/master/gif/zemoga_2.gif)

**Objective:** Build a REST app to show posts and extra information

**Deadline:** 3 days after Friday 2 of October, 2020.

## Architectural Pattern

** I choose to go with a MVVM pattern since for the app to build I believe its more suited**

The architectural pattern are presented by layers:
-	*Presentation Layer:* This layer includes all components related to the UI
-	*Domain Layer:* This is an extension of the business logic, its commonly used to satisfy the business model.
-	*Data Layer:* This layer functionality allows the app to have a clear communication of what to read and delete
